The goal for the project was to build a flexible framework suitable for experimenting with the AI/ML concepts using a problem of autonomous micro-aerial vehicles (MAVs) attempting to locate fires in buildings after a natural disaster, such as an earthquake. Secondary goal was implement collision avoidance mechanism, so that MAVs could avoid colliding with building or other MAVs. The simulator framework was written in Java to facilitate portability, provide a consistent GUI across different platforms. The simulator framework was successfully tested on Linux, MacOS and Windows platforms with Java 5 installed.
